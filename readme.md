# **RoboBrrd Dashboard**

RoboBrrd dashboard is a great way to set the minimum, maximum, and home positions of the servos on your RoboBrrd. You can also use the sliders to control the servos. There are handy action buttons to jump to the basic positions, and control the RGB LED eyes. The values of the photocells (or whichever sensors you are using) are displayed as a bar graph. Plus, choose which theme you want to use!

RoboBrrd Dashboard saves the positions and your current theme when you change it. When you start the application again, your values will be as you saved them. You can watch it in action in [this video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsRBAcZrh2U).
